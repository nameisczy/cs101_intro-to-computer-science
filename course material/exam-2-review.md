# Structure

## Overview

The exam will take place during class time. It will be composed of two parts:

1. Google Form Quiz (40%)
1. GitHub Assignment (60%)

---

template: structure

## Accepting the Exam

Students **must** accept the exam by...

1. Clicking the link provided by the instructor to the Google Form.
1. Clicking the link provided by the instructor to the GitHub Assignment, and following the instructions therein to "accept" the assignment.

---

template: structure

## Submitting the Exam

Students **must** submit the exam by the end of the exam period.

1. Click the Submit button on the Google Form.
1. `push` the GitHub Assignment code to GitHub.

---

## Verifying Your Submission

Students **must** verify on your own that you have actually submitted the exam.

1. See the confirmation message on the Google Quiz after clicking submit.
1. Click the link provided by the instructor to the GitHub Assignment, and verifying that your code has been pushed to the repository.

name: arraylist

# ArrayList

--

## Main themes

- a class in the Java API (i.e. `java.util.ArrayList`)
- behaves similarly to the fundamental primitive array data structure, but has a malleable length and stores only objects
- easy to `add()`, `remove()`, and `get()` objects to/from an `ArrayList`.
- odd syntax, e.g. `ArrayList<Alien> = new ArrayList<Alien>()`, which we won't talk about (called Java "generics")

---

name: multidimensional-arrays

# Multidimensional Arrays

--

## Main themes

- must first understand one-dimensional arrays
- two-dimensional arrays can be visualized as tables with rows and columns
  - first dimension is like the rows
  - second dimension is like the columns
- declaring, allocating, and assigning values
- looping through multi-dimensional arrays
  - the 'standard' way using nested counter-based loops
  - using the **foreach** type of loop (e.g. `for (String[] val : values) { /* ... */ }`)
- ragged arrays exist
- passing arrays as arguments to methods

---

name: #oop

# Object-Oriented Programming

--

## Main themes

Basic object-oriented programming

- Classes are a sort of representation of Platonic idealism and a solution to the metaphysical problem of universals.
- Classes are essentially custom data types.
- Classes are reference types in Java.
- Objects are instances of a class.
- Defining a class
- Constructors
- Instance methods and properties
- Static methods and properties
- Instantiating an object

name: pillars

# Pillars

--

## Main themes

The **4 pillars** of object-oriented programming theory:

- abstraction
- encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism

---

name: patterns

# Patterns

--

## Main themes:

- `private` for instance properties and methods
- getters and setters to provide public access for `private` properties, where desired
- perform validation in setters
- always use those setters, even within the same class file
- overloaded methods and contructors provide multiple variants of the same action
- `static` for shared properties and methods
- `final` for values that never change
- inheritance vs. composition

---

name: strings

# Strings

--

## Main themes:

- `String` is a class in the Java API, not a fundamental primitive data type.
- because different objects are stored at different locations in memory, compare the value of two `String` objects with its custom `.equals()` method, not `==`.
- `String` is designed following the principle of object-oriented abstraction (e.g. `.length()` rather than `.length`)
- Encapsulated within every `String` is a `char` array.
- Because `String` has been designed to be immutable and quite limited, a variety of helper classes exist to work around that (e.g. `StringBuilder`, Apache Commons Lang's `StringUtils`, etc)

---

name: inheritance

# Inheritance

--

## Main themes:

- Child classes inherit properties and methods of parent classes, except...
  - `private` properties and methods are not inherited...
  - ...but `private` properties are still accessible via any inherited `public` getters and setters
  - constructors are not inherited, but are accessible via the `super` keyword
- use of the `super` keyword to refer to code belonging to the parent class

---

template: inheritance

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism goes hand-in-hand with inheritance.

- child objects can be considered to be of their parent class.
- e.g., if `B` inherits from `A`, then a `B` object can be referred to as both a `B` and an `A` object.
- can be useful when storing objects of a variety of child types into a single array typed as the parent type.
- that allows you to easily loop through them all.
- `typeof` operator allows you to check whether an object is of a given type.

---

template: inheritance

## Processing

Processing as a case study in inheritance:

- inheritance of many useful properties (e.g. `width`, `height`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`)
- inheritance of many useful methods (e.g. `ellipse()`, `rect()`, `image()`, etc)
- inheritance of behaviors (e.g. `draw()` method magically called every 1/60th second, `mouseX` and `mouseY` automagically assigned the mouse position values)
- abstraction: we don't need to know _how_ it works, just how to use it
- some poor quality design (e.g. we should not be able to directly access `width`, `height`, `mouseX` and `mouseY` - we should be using getters)

---

name: this-super

# This is Super

--

## Main themes:

- the `this` keyword, when used within a method, refers to the object upon which that method was called.
- you cannot use the `this` keyword within a `static` method, since that method can never be called on an object.
- the `super` keyword, when used within a method, refers to code in the parent class.
- a call to the parent class's constructor can be added to a child class constructor, if useful (e.g. `super()` or `super(someArgs)`
